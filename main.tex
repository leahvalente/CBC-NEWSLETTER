\subsection*{Cornell Blockchain Accelerator}
    The Cornell Blockchain Accelerator, led by Yousuf Qaum, is dedicated to fostering innovation and growth in the blockchain sector. 
    \vspace{0.2cm}
    \noindent
    To date, the program has completed three cohorts, encompassing 12 startups that have collectively raised over \$2.4 million. Now held annually during the spring semester, the accelerator offers technical workshops, business and strategy lectures, with flagship events including mid-semester pitch deck reviews and a Demo Day at the Cornell Blockchain Conference.
    
    \vspace{0.2cm}
    \noindent
    As we prepare for our next launch in the spring of 2025, the accelerator is seeking assistance with mentorship, providing startup credits, and other support typical of accelerator programs. Please reach out to \textcolor{blue}{yaq2@cornell.edu} if you have any information or leads to help us run the program.

        \subsection*{Education Team}
            \textbf{CS-1998:} 
            This semester's edition of the Intro to Blockchain class was taught by Ilan Klimberg.
            Throughout the semester, Ilan remained true to his vision of providing an accessible course to all individuals by reducing the technical knowledge encouraged in prior semesters and expanding the scope
            of the concepts covered such as a brief introduction to TradFi and DeFi by guest lecturer Diego Fernandez.
            The class also gained first hand insight into the developing industry
            through guest lectures by industry leader and club alumni Nick Stamm!
            Ilan plans to add more guest lecturers in the future.  Additionally, the class will include labs where students will make wallets together, mint NFTs, and present on cryptocurrencies they believe will go up based on metrics learned in class.
            \noindent
            \\\\
            \textbf{CS-4998:} 
            This brand new course taught by Rodrigo Villar (head of reasearch at CBC) introduced students to the Solidity smart contract language as well as development tools such as Hardhat, Infura, Metamask. This 12 week course was taught using the following \href{https://cs4998.cornellblockchain.org}{textbook}, fully developed by Rodrigo Villar.

        \subsection*{Governance Team}
            Governance this semester has been voting on Arbitrum, with proposals so far including protocol improvements, budget adjustments, smart contract optimizations, and initiatives involving the network's security and scalability. Some more specific ones are the Stable Treasury Endowment Program, which creates a sustainable endowment for financial stability, and LTIPP, which solves the problem of burdens on delegates by creating alternate incentives with a council approach. We've also recently gained delegation in Optimism governance, where we are becoming active and voting on new proposals there as well. There are many different proposals across both platforms, but we vote every week after doing adequate research.

        This semester, the Consulting Team engaged in two notable activities. First, we partnered with AthenaDAO, a DAO focused on funding womenâ€™s health initiatives. We researched proposed Web3 data storage solutions to improve data security, user accessibility, and scalability for various organizational needs. Second, we were one of fifteen clubs at Cornell selected to participate in the Deloitte Undergraduate Case Competition. Our team analyzed a business problem and presented our solution to consultants at Deloitte.
